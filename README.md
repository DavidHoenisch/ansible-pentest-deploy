## Pentest Tools Deployer with Ansible

In preperation for an upcoming assessment, I've be searching for a new way to deploy
an ephemoral work station. Most of the method I've employed in the past were 
unreliable. Having used ansible extensivly in my career I was excited to find a
solution that employed ansible. However, with the last commit being in 2017 and
pull requests over 4 years old it become obvious that the project was not longer
being worked on, and thus, this fork.

A big thank you to Steve Coward for the work he put in or the original structure.

This project will seek to update the original content of the project to get it 
in work order and install the most recent versions of application. Some tools
may be removed due to the fact that they are no longer maintained and new ones 
added in. 


### Assumptions

A few assumptions are made with this particular iteration of the Ansible playbook:

* The target systems are Debian 7.x or greater (support for multiple OSes to follow later)
* Ansible is installed on the host deploying the Ansible playbook (see below for installation steps)
* This assumes root + public key authentication access to the target host(s) is feasible
* Python 2.x is installed on the target host(s)
* `group_vars/all` is filled in with a username and linux password hash for the password value
 
### Installation and Usage

On the deployment host, Ansible needs to be installed and two Ansible roles
must be installed via `ansible-galaxy`:

```
> pip install ansible
> ansible-galaxy install rvm_io.ruby naftulikay.go-dev
```

Designate a file to house one or many target host IP addresses, formatted like
so:

```
[c2]
10.0.0.15
10.0.0.20
```

Run the Ansible playbook:

```
> ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```
